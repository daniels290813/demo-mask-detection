    "The following example demonstrates a training workflow that builds and trains a model that classifies whether a person is wearing a mask or not. The training is auto-logged to both Tensorboard and MLRun, and easily distributed using Horovod. Post training, we will run an evaluation to check our model's performance, updating the logging as a part of a routine test.\n",
